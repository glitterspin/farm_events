This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn). 

Still trying to fix the folder structure; right now, it seems like the project has an unnecessary top folder. I think leaving it like this would be okay, but I want it to look nice and clean when I'm done.

The folder structure is getting better but it still needs some love. The extra top folder is confusing for sure.

update: restarting the whole project. This is the kind of thing that should be fixed as edits start, and since it's a pretty simple tutorial projct, the cost of restarting isn't too high/harsh.
