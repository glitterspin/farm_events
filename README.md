This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn). 

Still trying to fix the folder structure; right now, it seems like the project has an unnecessary top folder. I think leaving it like this would be okay, but I want it to look nice and clean when I'm done.

The folder structure is getting better but it still needs some love. The extra top folder is confusing for sure.
